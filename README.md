ex4 -> PrintName.java: creates a variable name, of type String + then assigns my name (Aoibhe) to it -> program then prints the value assigned to the variable to the screen -> the value must be read from the variable: e.g String name = Aoibhe; (Your name is Aoibhe)
ex5 -> WhileOdd.java: implements a counter controlled while loop that prints out odd numbers only from 1 to 10 inclusive: output must contain Aoibhe e.g (Odd numbers, Aoibhe)
ex6 -> ForOdd.java: implements a for loop that prints out odd numbers only from 1 to 10 inclusive: output must contain Aoibhe

ex8 -> Miles.java: prompts the user to enter a number of miles, then converts the miles entered into kilometers, the result of this conversion is printed to the screen (Aoibhe. Enter number of miles / x miles = x km) round number of km to 2 decimal places
ex9 -> Kilometers.java: prompts the user to enter a number of kilometers, then convert the km into miles: round to 2 dp
ex10 -> MilesMethod.java: implements a method to convert miles into km -> it should pass a value, number of miles entered by a user, to this method -> the method should return the result of converting the miles passed to it to km -> the main method should then print out the result of the conversion: note that the method for doing this conversion can be a static or instance method (Aoibhe. Enter a number of miles / x miles is x km) must contain Aoibhe
